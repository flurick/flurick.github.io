<h1>Alan Watts</h1>
<blockquote>The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Seeing that there isnt really anything we can do, to imporove our self or to improve the world. If we realize that that is so it gives us a breather, in the course of which we may simply watch what is going on, watch what happends ... and don't be in a hurry to think you know what it is.
